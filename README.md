## Hi, I'm Matthew Lewis
I'm a Computer Science and Data Science student at the University of Florida (expected '27), diving headfirst into the worlds of AI, simulations, geospatial ML, and game development. I love turning complex ideas into tangible tools that push the boundaries of what's possible, whether it's for real-world applications or immersive gaming experiences.
### Currently Working On

-Neural Network Drone Project: Simulating drone swarms with NN control for SEAD/DEAD missions in Unity.

-Mixed Reality Training System: Brainstorming a hybrid MR platform blending real-world actions with Unity-based battlespaces for military training.

-Para Bellum: Large-scale strategy game inspired by post-apocalyptic worlds, featuring faction dynamics, seasonal systems, and modular RTS battles.
